# Cypher's IP Addresses Blacklist

The longer I run a Minecraft server on the typical port the more scam, spam / obnoxious  IP address try to ping it. Some are just script kiddies perusing the open internet, some are professional security companines checking for vulnerabilities, or just players looking for any server to connect to spam unwanted adverts, and then leave. Over the past year or so I've collected quite the list of addresses; it's now time to release updates automatically as the server receives and processes them.

Rolling release model, wait for latest commit!?
